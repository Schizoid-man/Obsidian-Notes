`Advantages of AC system over DC system`
- AC ==voltages can be efficiently stepped== up/down using transformer
- AC ==motors are cheaper and simpler in construction== than DC motors
- ==Switchgear== for AC system is simpler than DC system


`Generation of sinusoidal AC voltage`
rectangular coil of N turns placed in uniform mag. field which is rotating in anti-clockwise direction at a uniform velocity of ${\omega}$ rad/sec.
